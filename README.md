# spotify-yt2mp3: The script that downloads your Spotify library as mp3 from youtube videos 
This script allows you to automatically make a local backup of your Spotify library. If the script is run it detects changes (eg. songs added to a playlist)
and downloads them as a mp3 file from the most appropriate youtube video. Every mp3 file is tagged with the ID3 tags and the album cover is added. 
The songs are then organized in folders according to their playlist/album.
